<h1>About</h1>
<hr>
<p>My Name is Joshua Jenkins, many would describe me as a athlete, but i am so much more, and with J23 i seek to show and inspire many others that they are much more than athletes, much more than products of their enviroment and that no matter where you are from or what situation and platform you were given, you can always find a way to be a star.</p>

<h1>Early life</h1>
<hr>
<p>In my early life i was born in Chicago llinois, where i then moved to Des Moines, Iowa at age eight. From there i grew up to become a boy very involved in a variety of sports and activites my main one being baseball. In 7th grade is when i discovered football, highly inspired by my older brother Justin. I then began playing football and excelled at a young age and even throughout 8th grade and freshman year gaining the approval of the highschool coaches which led to me being named as the starting Running back my freshman year. After a up and down High school career with many tries and tribulations i am where i am today</p>

<h1>Today</h1>
<hr>
<p>Today I am a Runningback for the University of Northern Iowa, my goal is to inspire. From a school like Lincoln in Des Moines, we arent exactly known for our sports, and our athletes are often overlooked because of this. I created J23, my name image and likness brand to inspire kids in similar situations and from similar evironments that you can do the same things all the big and well known athletes are doing, and to not be afraid to take a chance on yourself and build your own brand. That is my goal and that is my why.</p>
